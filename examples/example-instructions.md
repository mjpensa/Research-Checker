## Tips for Writing Instructions

### Good Instructions Include:
✅ Total timeline duration (number of weeks)

### Avoid:
❌ Vague descriptions
❌ Missing timeline information
❌ Unrealistic schedules
❌ Too many overlapping tasks
❌ Unclear phase boundaries

## Using with Documents

When including research documents:
1. The AI will extract relevant information from your documents
2. Instructions should reference how to use the document content
3. Documents can include project briefs, requirements, timelines, team capacity, etc.

Example instruction with documents:
```
Based on the attached project brief and requirements document, create a Gantt chart that allocates the described features across appropriate development sprints. Use a 12-week timeline and organize into planning, design, development, testing, and launch phases.
```
